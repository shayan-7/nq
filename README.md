# nq
N-Queen problem solve

#### Usage

Just **Make** it:

```bash
$ make
```

Then run the output `a.out` with argument <N> representing chessboard dimensions, For example:

```bash

$ ./a.out 4

0 1 0 0 
0 0 0 1 
1 0 0 0 
0 0 1 0 
```

**NOTE:** If your input <N> is equavalent or more than **30**, it may take a while to achieve the result because of recursion level depth.
